**Credit Card Debt Prediction**
This notebook demonstrates a predictive model for credit card debt (Balance) using customer attributes from credit.csv. We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), build a linear regression model, evaluate model diagnostics, and suggest improvements.

For user frendliness I have added files in 2 formats:
1. Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
2. html format

**Steps**
1. Problem Definition
2. Load the dataset
3. Inspect dataset structure and check for missing values
4. Convert categorical variables to dummy variables
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6. Define predictors (X) and response variable (y)
7. Split the data into training and testing sets
8. Add constant for statsmodels linear regression
9. Plot histogram and QQ plot to check normality of residuals
10. Perform Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
